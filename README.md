# Pick-a-color-App
This is a very simple App made with Svelte JS, it lets you pick a color and copy it to your clipboard through a pretty fancy UI.

I've got to admit that i'm in love with Svelte JS, it's so simple yet so powerful, it's amazing for small projects like this and im pretty sure that with the right architecture you can build big apps with it.

Here's the link of the official Svelte site: https://svelte.dev/
